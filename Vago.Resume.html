			<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">Two of my favorite fieldtrips that I took in the past four years of high school was the SAP trip and the LAM Research trip. I went on the SAP trip during my Freshman year. We learned a lot about what they did there and what we should do to get good jobs. We got to see the entire workspace as well as eat at the venue. We got to meet some of the people working there as well. The main thing I learned from them was to follow your dreams in what you want to become. I was selected to be one of the six kids who got to go on the LAM Reasearch fieldtrip during my Junior year. It was one of my favorite fieldtrips because of how much we learned and also because we got to meet so many kids from different schools. We learned about lasers and how they simulate stars, we learned how to build a desktop, and we also learned about what they did for the government.</p> 
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">My mentor for the mentorship program in high school was Robert Bennett and he works at AT&T. Even though I did not want to go into computer science he was a good mentor to have. He taught me a lot about what to do in job interviews and he helped me figure out what colleges I wanted to apply to. Another thing I enjoyed from the mentorship program was getting to meet the other mentors as well. I got to speak to civil engineers and other types of engineers as well throughout the process and it was very helpful.</p>
