													<li><p>This project was done for two to three weeks, and the project was done in pairs. The project was done for the Project Lead The Way class. The goal of the game is to hit the cars with the arrows, but if you hit a police car the game is over. Me and my partner divided the codeing in half, so I did half of the code and she did the other half. I learned how to use scratch in a different way that I am used to, and I learned how to work better in pairs. We did have some trouble making the cars move across the screen randomly, but we fixed that using the block that allows the computer to choose where the car will drive to. A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLucrrVEOxRscISCRMbBOsUWq_jjNowKpLJ3UVQ0tds/edit?usp=sharing">project log </a>was created with pictures of code and descriptions of what we did every day.</p></li>
