			<h2>Computer Science Engineering Projects</h2>
				<p>We have created projects in class, some projects are from Scratch, Google, App Inventor, and Cloud 9.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scratch</li>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Car Game</p>
									<ul>
										<li><p>Link to game:   <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76725650/">Scratch</a>
											<ul>
													<li><p>This project was done for two to three weeks, and the project was done in pairs. The project was done for the Project Lead The Way class. The goal of the game is to hit the cars with the arrows, but if you hit a police car the game is over. Me and my partner divided the codeing in half, so I did half of the code and she did the other half. I learned how to use scratch in a different way that I am used to, and I learned how to work better in pairs. We did have some trouble making the cars move across the screen randomly, but we fixed that using the block that allows the computer to choose where the car will drive to. A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLucrrVEOxRscISCRMbBOsUWq_jjNowKpLJ3UVQ0tds/edit?usp=sharing">project log </a>was created with pictures of code and descriptions of what we did every day.</p></li>

											<ul>
												<li><p>This project was done in about three weeks, and the project was again done in pairs. The project was done for the Project Lead The Way computer science class. The game is a drawing app that you can download pictures onto and draw on them. The app allows you to change the color and the thickness of the lines, and it also lets you change the background color form white to any other color you want. Me and my partner divided our work in half, and we both designed what our project was going to look like. We did have some problems making the camera to work, but then we figured out what we did wrong and fixed that. We made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vcTnz4HYrCuEPgztpcsSBU6eZ4Q4fpzrsO4yiEyr0VI/edit?usp=sharing">project log </a>to show what we did every single day.</p></li>

											<ul>
												<li><p>The project was done in about two or three weeks. The project was worked on in pairs. The project was for The Project Lead The Way Class, but we decided on the topic of our adventure. The game gives you a crime scene and a list of suspects. You have to figure out who kiled the barber out of the suspects. The suspects will have a brief conversation with the investigator and then depending on the way they answered you will know who is guilty and who is not. Me and my partner divided the work in half. We both created storylines for all of the characters. We had a bit of issues debugging our code. We used a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5v_l7fLsRyDMzhVTDFJaTVwUlU/view?usp=sharing">flow chart</a> to keep our game organized and so we knew what to do next. We used a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15l4qS0FZu3qE-AgCJ-HB00rnzNPV6-IAIevPJWtVVJc/edit?usp=sharing">project log</a> to keep track of what we needed to get done.</p></li>

										<li><p>Downloadable file:   <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5v_l7fLsRyDSEszOEhDaWcweWc/view?usp=sharing">Python</a></p></li>
											<ul>
												<li><p>This project was done in a week. We did this project in pairs. The project was done for the Project Lead The Way class. The game is a hangman game that chooses a word with the topic disney characters for you to guess. It lets you guess one letter at a time to try to figure out what the word is. Then when you know the word you can guess the full word to see if it is correct. Every time you run the code it will pick a random word for you to guess. Me and my partner divided the work in half, and we both decided on the topic of our game as well as the characters we wanted to put in it. We did have some issues with making the game print correctly, but we were able to fix the issue. We did not keep a project log for this game. We commented the code instead.</p></li>

								<li>Image Manipulation</li>
									<ul>
										<li><p>Downloadable file:   <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5v_l7fLsRyDaEJuWnFaY25KSzg/view?usp=sharing">Python</a></p></li>
											<ul>
												<li><p>This project was done in a week. We did this project in pairs. The project was done for the Project Lead The Way class. In this project we manipulated an image twice. We fliped the image upside-down and changed it to be black and white. Our code is able to change any and all images in a folder no matter the size or the color. Me and my partner divided the work evenly, and we both came into agreement about what we wanted to do. We had some issues making the images become black and white, but after a couple days of working on it we finally got it to work. We did not keep a project log for the image manipulation, but we did put comments in our code.</p></li>

												<ul>
													<li><p>The project was done in about two weeks. I did this project in a group of three people, but the three people could have been from any engineering class there is at my school. My two partners were from Introduction to Engineering Design. We made this project for The Engineering Accademy. This project was the largest project we had to do all year. The goal of the project is to fix something that was wrong with the world. We had many different ideas and we made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19gCM05SVaRKj-2tuxMNnN8sj7ddMI063J6PXxN_hZOY"> brainstorming page</a> full of our different ideas. We had to create a project that would allow them to create a model of some sort, and also for me to code. Our decision is highlighted on that document, and it was a portable cup holder that was designed to fix all of the spill stains we see around campus. We made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Mq9cRbcrlETc1BcTYMVJT4v5Gi7CmOGs4kjM1vy-nfY">document</a> to explain our project. The document explains what was the problem we solved, what were past solutions to the problem, and also a description of our project. The project document also describes what each of my partners did. We also made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KKAaNYZ9_w-3dgwyHnEuChbjxeItouN95rN6oQyFHJk/edit?usp=sharing"> google slides</a> that we used to present to our class. The document explains our project, explains why our project is better, and further improvements we can make. We also made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ai48jVXCUBkAzvGvKxXXqjJcJSGIOdd_GSVeyIFfTzk">project log</a> which kept track of everything we did each day.</p></li>

			<h2>Principles Of Engineering Projects</h2>
				<p>We make physical Projects and then use google to document them.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Mechanical Winch System</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Link to Documentation:   <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWS94XeJis22TNwSTA_wG4b6oSts-lbAQpY1Ar-O4Rk/edit?usp=sharing">Document</a>
									<ul>
										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 4. This project was done for the Principles of Engineering Class. This Project started on October 14th and ended on October 18th. The objective of this project was to create a pulley that lifted a minimum weight of 100g up around 30cm. We had to use a fisher tech motor to power the machine. My role in the project was to build the machine and take the measurements needed to find the efficiency. I also had to write the paragraph explaining what or machine does. I learned about how to work with different people and learned how to keep myself and others on task. My group had a lot of issues with keeping on task and we overcame that challenge by making sure everyone was always doing something for the project. I got all of my work done and had time to help others with theirs.</p>

									<ul>
										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 3. This project was done for Principles of Engineering. This project started on August 30th and ended on September 8th. The objective of this project was to build something that can help the people living in a compound. The project was not allowed to use energy and had to have only one force imput. It was also mandatory to use at least four different mechanisms. My role in this project was mainly to do the documentation. I helped build the physical prodotype as well, but I mostly wrote up the needed documentation. I learned how to keep all of my work organized and how to plan ahead for problems we knew we would have.</p></li>

										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 3. This project was done for Principles of Engineering. This project started on November 3rd and ended on November 17th. The objective of this project was to make a car that can use both solar and hydrogen fuel cells to power it. After making this car we had to figure out what kind of energy was the best type to use on a real car and then we had to write a recomendation paragragraph based on that energy source we chose. My role in this project was to build and help test the car. I also had to do the testing summary for the documentation so I had to make sure I had all of the needed data in my notebook. I leaned how to quickly and efficiently finish work because my group had to start our car over multiple times because it was not working at first.</p></li>

									<ul>
										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 3. This project was done for Principles of Engineering. This project started on January 30th and ended on February 2nd. The objective of this project was to create a rocket that will go the furthest distance when launched at a specific psi. After creating our first rocket we built a second one based on how our first design did during testing. My role in this project was to build my own rocket and write the data when we tested out in the field. I also had to do the testing summary for my rocket in the documentation so I had to make sure I had all of the needed data in my notebook. I learned how to be patient and how to get work done in a productive manner because we only had about one day to finish up our rocket prototypes.</p></li>

										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 4. This project was done for Principles of Engineering. This project started on February 9th and ended on February 21nd. The objective of this project was to create a eco friendly, recyclable, and cheap insulation. After creating our insulation we placed it on a heat box to see how effective ours was. My role in this project was to bring in dirt and aluminum foil for my team. I also did half of the material descriptions, part of the design brief, part of the calculations and the graph, as well as part of the summary.I learned how to cooperate with others and how to stay on task while working because for half of the project two of my teammates were absent and that made it hard for me to have the will to work. During those days I pushed myself to finish the work I had to do and distribute the rest of the work between the two absent group members.</p></li>

									<ul>
										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 2. This project was done for Principles of Engineering. This project started on March 14th and ended on March 22nd. The objective of this project was to create a bridge that could support a truck going over it. It was also supposed to be cheap and pleasing to the eye. After finising a bridge prodotype we would put it through a simulation to make sure it works. My role in this project was to make two of the four prodotypes. I also did most of the design brief, the decision matrix, as well as the final solution paragraph.I learned how to perservere and finish all of my work as well as helping others finish theirs. My group was under a big time constraint because of the fact that both of us were absent on the first work day for this project. Since we did not have as much time to work we had to finish most of our stuff at home and focus on making the bridges in class.</p></li>

										<li><p>This project was done in a group of 4. This project was done for Principles of Engineering. This project started on April 25th and ended on May 5th. The objective of this project was to create a machine that could move a cookie to a transporting location and then to a packaging location. We had to build the machine out of vx and then we had to code for the machine to work. My role in this project was to build most of the prodotype. I also did some of the documentation. I learned to work under pressure. My group had a very small time frame to get this whole project done. We had to meet up during lunch, free period, and some of us stayed after school as well.

The goal of the project is to fix something that was wrong with the world. We had many different ideas at first but we decided on a specific idea later on. We did not have any project constraints because we were all in the same class. We finally decided to make a pocket for peoples clothing so that people can fit more stuff in their pockets. We also made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1to7hpxH2oXeic3Ib2ALrWqSMyTUZa_Xf5I7MB8MLt2s"> google slides</a> that we used to present to our class.</p></li>

								<li><p>Link to Documentation:   <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K1SL6nivcvBP7s8EkxJegmGnXgjyjMRmoRMfu4Fe5us">Document</a>
									<ul>
										<li><p>This project was done for the Computer Integrated Manufacturig class. This project was created during the months of November and December. The objective of this project was to create a buisness card that had our name on it as well as some sort of design of our choice using the Laser Cutter. The requirements for this project is that we had one thing engraved and one thing cut out. We also had to create some sort of border as well as fit the design on a 3.5 inch by 2 inch space. This project was an individual project so I did all of the designing and documentation as well as creating the project. I learned a lot about time management and when to finish one thing before another. In my project a hardship I had to deal with how thick to make the cut out I wanted so that pieces would still stay attatched to the entire buisness card. In the end I was able to figure out the proper dimensions and I was able to get it to print out perfectly. </p></li>

									<ul>
										<li><p>This project was done individually and it was done for Computer Integrated Manufacturing class. This project was done during January. The goal of this project was to cut out our initials into a block using the CNC Milling machine. Some of the requirements that needed to be hit was that there needed to be a chamfered border around the block and our design needed to have at least one arc in it. I did all of the codeing, cutting, and documentation for this project on my own. One of the hardships I had during this project was being able to create my code and have it work properly. The problem that was happening was that part of the cut was not showing up on the verification window, and it took a long time to figure out. I ended up having to switch up some of my numbers to be able to get it to work properly. I learned how to code using G&M code and I learned how to use the CNC Mill as well.</p></li>
