								<p>I did this project in a group of three people, but the three people could have been from any engineering class there is at my school. My two partners were from Introduction to Engineering Design. We made this project for The Engineering Accademy in about two to three weeks. The goal of the project is to fix something that was wrong with the world. We had many different ideas and we made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19gCM05SVaRKj-2tuxMNnN8sj7ddMI063J6PXxN_hZOY"> brainstorming page</a> full of our different ideas. We had to create a project that would allow them to create a model of some sort, and allow me to code. Our decision is highlighted on that document, and it was a portable cup holder that was designed to fix all of the spill stains we see around campus. We made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Mq9cRbcrlETc1BcTYMVJT4v5Gi7CmOGs4kjM1vy-nfY">document</a> to explain our project.We also made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KKAaNYZ9_w-3dgwyHnEuChbjxeItouN95rN6oQyFHJk/edit?usp=sharing"> google slides</a> that we used to present to our class.

The objective of this project was to make a car that can use both solar and hydrogen fuel cells to power it. After making this car we had to figure out what kind of energy was the best type to use on a real car and then we had to write a recomendation paragragraph based on that energy source we chose.
