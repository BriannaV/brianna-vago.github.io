				<p style="text-indent:3em;">My name is Brianna Vago. I am currently enrolled at the University of Oregon as a Sophomore. I am a Computer Science major and I am considering doing a Portuguese minor as well. I have taken a few CS classes at my school already and I really enjoy doing the projects. It takes a lot of hard work and energy to keep up with my school work, and on top of that I have a few extracurricular activities as well.</p>
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">I have been doing extracurricular activities for many years that relate to individual and team success. I do Acrobatics and Tumbling for the school. This sport requires a lot of focus and trust because not everyone on the team will be doing everything at the meets. This allows you to show responsibility for what you are assigned to do as well as being able to support your teammates in what they are responsible for. Another extracurricular I still do is All-Star Cheerleading. I was a world champion in 2018 and 2019 and now I cheer for a team in Brazil. These teams require a lot of hard work, pain, and perseverance. You also have to learn how to be cooperative with others, and supportive. When we are practicing our routine at our gym we have to make sure we cooperate with our coaches and follow their directions. We also have to be supportive of the team members that are struggling or that are new to the team. Even with all of the time I have to put into Acrobatics and Tumbling as well as cheer I still have time to work on personal coding projects and homework. I thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy looking through the rest of my site.
