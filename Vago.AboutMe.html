				<p style="text-indent:3em;">My name is Brianna Vago. I am currently enrolled in Dublin High School as a Senior. Right now I am part of the Engineering Academy and that is where I dedicate a lot of my time and energy. My career interest are Computer Programming or Civil Engineering. I have taken classes based on those two careers to make a decision on which one I will be focusing on in college. In college I will be focusing on Civil Engineering, and doing a decent amount of extracurricular activities.</p>
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">I have been doing extracurricular activities for many years that relate to individual and team success. I did competitive artistic gymnastics for many years. Gymnastics is an individual sport where you have to use your skills to make a creative routine to compete against other individuals. Another extracurricular activity that helped me in many skills was All-Star Cheerleading. These teams require a lot of hard work, pain, and perseverance. You also have to learn how to be cooperative with others, and supportive. When we are practicing our routine at our gym we have to make sure we cooperate with our coaches and follow their directions. We also have to be supportive of the team members that are struggling or that are new to the team. I have a very active lifestyle, and my sport requires a lot of training and effort. Even with all of the time I have to put into cheer I still have time to work on personal coding projects and homework. I thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy looking through the rest of my site.</p>
