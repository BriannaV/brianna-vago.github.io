				<p style="text-indent:3em;">My name is Brianna Vago. I am currently enrolled in Dublin High School as a junior. My career interest are Computer Programmer or Civil Engineer. I took and will be taking classes based on those two careers to make a decision on which one I will be focusing on in college. In college I will be focusing only on that career choice, and doing a decent amount of extracurricular activities. My parents have experience in both of these fields, because of that and my love for puzzles made me interested in those two careers path.</p>
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">I have been doing extracurricular activities for many years that are relate to individual and team success. I did competitive artistic gymnastics for many years. Gymnastics is an individual sport where you have to use your skills to make a creative routine to compete against other individuals. Another extracurricular activity that helped me in many skills was All Star Cheerleading. These teams require a lot of hard work, pain, and perseverance. You also have to learn how to be cooperative with others, and supportive. When we are practicing our routine at our gym we have to make sure we cooperate with our coaches and follow their directions. We also have to be supportive of the team members that are struggling or that are new to the team. </p>
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">I spend my free time coding with my brother so I can learn different coding languages. I am also doing this so I can see how much I like coding and see if I want to be a computer programmer. I think that coding is a great thing to learn because it can be applied to many other careers. Right now I am part of the Engineering Academy and that is where I dedicate a lot of my time and energy.</p>
				<p style="text-indent:3em;">I have a very active lifestyle, and my sport requires a lot of training and effort. Even with all of the time I have to put into cheer I still have time to work on personal coding projects and homework. I am looking forward to deciding what career path I will choose for my life. I thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy looking through the rest of my site.</p>
